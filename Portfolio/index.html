                        <h1>Why am I here?</h1>
                            <p>If you would have asked me even last year if I would ever find myself taking a coding program, I would have laughed and shaken my head. I've always told myself that "my brain doesn't work this way" because I am a writer, I am into language, etc. 
                            The truth is, however, that I just haven't exercised this aspect of myself fully, and I may actually just be really scared to try. I am a technical writer by trade and I am now working with software engineers, when for the past seven years or so, I had been writing operational documentation. 
                            I have finally come to terms with the reality that challenging myself with this program will benefit me in multiple ways- not only career-wise, but also in proving to myself that I can do something that 
                            I didn't think I was capable of. So I am happy to be here! Here is a little bit about me below.</p>

                                    <p>I mentioned earlier, writing is my original passion. I have been writing since I was in seventh grade, and knew at an early age that I always wanted 
                                     writing to be a part of my life. I majored in English Literature from San Jose State University in California, and have had a few pieces published in alumni literary magazines. 
                                    During the pandemic, I submitted a couple of articles about the pandemic and self-care to an online literary magazine and they were published! That was one positive outcome 
                                    of the pandemic for me (besides being able to wear sweats constantly, get much more sleep, feel genuinely rested for probably the first time in my life and many other things).</p>

                        <p>One of my other passions, or more of a lifestyle choice is wellness. I don't mean wellness as in bubble baths by candlelight(even though they are also amazing), but moreso
                        as building a life that I don't feel the need to escape from. That usually means pinpointing things that are keeping me from "living my best life" and resolving them if I can, and letting them go
                        if I can't. Physical activity and mindfulness practices, such as yoga, running, and meditation help me live the wellness life in a big way. I gain clarity, ward off anxiety, and feel accomplished 
                        for taking care of myself when I do these things. Over the past couple of years, which have been challenging for everyone, I have been able to dedicate more time to these practices and I can 
                        really feel the difference.
